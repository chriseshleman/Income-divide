```

## Census tract income for four states. 
```{r, include=FALSE}
setwd("/Users/chriseshleman/Dropbox/Income analysis 2018/ACS_16_5YR_S1901") 
all_content = readLines("./ACS_16_5YR_S1901_with_ann.csv") 
skip_second = all_content[-2]
basics = read.csv(textConnection(skip_second), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dict = read.csv("./ACS_16_5YR_S1901_metadata.csv")
head(dict, 5) 
```

Dictionary got loaded at the end. 

Variables: 
Household count is HC01_EST_VC01, 
Median household income is HC01_EST_VC13, and 
Mean (average) household income is HC01_EST_VC15. 

I'll look into mean and median income. Maybe the difference will offer me some training-wheels indication of inequality. 
```{r, include=TRUE}
summary(as.numeric(basics$HC01_EST_VC13)) 
summary(as.numeric(basics$HC01_EST_VC15)) 
```
OK, we're in business ... 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(as.numeric(basics$HC01_EST_VC13))
```
